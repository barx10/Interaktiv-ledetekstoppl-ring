This might come in handy if du vil at Claude skal gjøre the same thing every time, but the data that Claude uses for its task might be different each time. Luckily, we can do this pretty easily by **separating the fixed skeleton av prompten from variable user input, then substituting the user input into the prompt** before sending the full prompt to Claude. Below, we'll walk step by step through how to write a substitutable prompt template, as well as how to substitute in user input."

Notice that the full prompt submitted to Claude is just the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` substituted with the input (in this case, \"Cow\"). Notice that the word \"Cow\" replaces the `ANIMAL` placeholder via an f-string when we print out the full prompt.**Note:** You don't have to call your placeholder variable anything in particular in practice. We called it `ANIMAL` in this example, but just as easily, we could have called it `CREATURE` or `A` (although it's generally good to have your variable names be specific and relevant so that your prompt template is easy to understand even without the substitution, just for user parseability). Just make sure that whatever you name your variable is what you use for the prompt template f-string."
